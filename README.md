# FOSC_phylogenomics_Westerdijk
Collection of small scripts written and used during my Fusarium oxysporum phylogenomics internship at the Westerdijk (Dec 2023- Sept 2024).

Scripts were written "Quick and dirty", often without much annotation or optimization.

In the file "Coding statements backup", I have copied all important commands used during my project, which is also where many of the scripts in this directory are called and used.

The variable "$Sequences_Anouk" refers to one of my folders in the file system of the Westerdijk. The complete path contained a space I did not have the permission to remove, so I put this alias in place to work around pathing issues.
